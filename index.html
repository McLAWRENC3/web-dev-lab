  <h2>i love learning html </h2>
  <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it's the foundation of almost every website. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s. The first version, HTML 1.0, had only 18 tags. HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it defines the structure and content of web pages, not their behavior. </p>
